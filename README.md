# Calculator in Java using JFrame 📱

This project involves creating a simple calculator in Java using the Swing library to build a graphical user interface. The calculator features a user-friendly interface that utilizes `JFrame`, `JButton`, `JTextField`, `JPanel`, and other Swing components, facilitating user interaction.

## Features 🔢

The calculator is capable of performing basic operations such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponentiation
- Squareroot

The buttons are organized in a grid layout to enhance usability.

## Calculation Logic 📝

The calculation logic is implemented to process user inputs and compute results, updating the display as operations are performed.

## Conclusion ☕

This project provides a great opportunity to practice concepts of object-oriented programming, event handling, and graphical user interface design in Java. However, the project is not yet 100% finished, the foundation has been laid, and there are opportunities for improvements in the future.
